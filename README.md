## Description
In this project, I created an employee management system for an organization using node, and mysql. Initially, I created a database using mysql and added tables and columns/rows. I used prompt to log questions to the user and manipulated database content using query. I created a function for each functionality available to the user and used a switch statement to run the a function for the appropriate data. I appreciate any feedback. Thank yoy!
